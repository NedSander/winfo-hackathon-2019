### About JobApplicationTrackr
Our project for the 2019 WINFO Hackathon is a web application that helps users keep track of the state of their job applications by aggregating user-entered data and ergonomically organizing the data.

Our group came up with the idea when contemplating the annoyances in our everyday lives, and we found the standard method of application tracking, Microsoft Excel, to be tedious and somewhat lacking. In this way, our web application makes a world of difference to us and to all fellow job seekers by organizing the state of our job searches, creating reminders for required actions, and generally removing a niggling annoyance of the job search process.
